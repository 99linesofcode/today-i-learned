# Scrum

### The Four Pillars of Scrum
* Transparancy
* Inspection
* Adaptation

### Values

* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect

Scrum prescribes four formal events:
1. Sprint Planning
1. Daily Scrum (often referred to as "The standup")
1. Sprint Review
1. Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Team

### Product Owner
> Responsible for maximizing value of the product and the work of the development team.

The product owner is the sole person responsible for maintaining the product backlog.
One person, not a committee. The product owner can delegate his/her work to the development team
but remains accountable.

* Clearly expresses product backlog items
* Orders the product backlog to achieve goals and missions
* Optimizes value of the work the development performs
* Ensures the product backlog is visible, transparant and clear to all
* Ensures the development team understands the product backlog to the level needed.

### The development team
> Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each sprint. Only members of this team create the Increment.

Optimal development team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a sprint.
Generally speaking, having more than nine members requires too much coordination.

* Self organising. No one tells the development team how to turn product backlog into increments
* Cross-functional, with all the skills necessary to create the increment
* All members are considered 'developers', regardless of the work being performed by a person; there are no exceptions
* Individual members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole.

### The Scrum Master
> Responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. A servant-leader to the Scrum team, the Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which interactions are helpful and which aren't.

##### Service to the Product Owner

* Finding techniques for effective backlog management;
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
* Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
* Understanding and practiciing agility and facilitating Scrum events as requested/needed.

##### Service to the Development Team

* Coaching the Development Team in self-organisation and cross-functionality;
* Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
* Removing impediments;

##### Service to the Organisation

* Leading and coaching the organisation in its Scrum adoption;
* Planning Scrum implementation within the organization;
* Helping eployees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;
* Working with other Scrum Masters to increase effectiveness of the application of Scrum within the organization.

## Scrum events

### The Sprint
> Time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

During the sprint:
* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality does not decrease;
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated.

Each sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work and the resultant product.

### Sprint Planning
> Inspect the product backlog, look at the velocity and review current state of the increment (product).

Discuss the definition of done and the Action Points from last Sprint Retrospective.

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

After forcasting the Product Backlog items to be delivered this Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal. This is the objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Increment.

##### How will the chosen work be done?

Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.

If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.

### Daily Scrum
> 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

* What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
* What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
* Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

Every day, the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint. The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.

### Sprint Review
> Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed);
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
* Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,
* Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.
* The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.

### Sprint Retrospective
> An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

* Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
* Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the definition of “Done” as appropriate.

### Scrum breakdown
1. Businesses express their needs
1. Product Owner defines the product vision and plans the release
1. Stories are chopped up into very small and ready pieces. All the details are clear.
1. During the sprint planning, the sprint gets defined. This results in the sprint backlog.
1. The definition of done is required such that the team can make proper estimations of the amount of work that fits in a sprint.
1. The sprint has a certain goal.
1. The development team has a daily standup where they plan the upcoming workday.
1. After the sprint, the Product Owner and the stakeholders get together for a sprint review.
1. The Scrum team comes together in the Retrospective to review and reflect upon the previous sprint.
1. During the retrospective improvement actions are defined such that the team can take those into account starting the next sprint.
1. The development team is not a team of developers (ie. programmers) but contains people from all disciplines.
1. Estimating a bug that is potentially large is OK.


* Restore trust
* Communicate and fix technical debt
* Fixing techincal debt means: stop creating debt, make a small payment every Sprint and repeat. Measure what you have now and inspect/review the code.
* Remember that we as developers are professionals and have a responsibility to guard that trust
* Transparency between team members and roles.
* Comments are a code smell!
* Hexagonal architecture
* Walking skeleton - Get an end to end test as soon as possible. Grow the system feature by feature. Always at high quality.
* Velocity should not be so high as to impact the quality of the code. This quality is agreed upon in the DOD.
* Refinement is not an official part of Scrum. It is up to the team to determine how often the PBL has to be refined as long as it is JIT and not too far in advance.
* Impact mapping
* Scrum values
* Task switching/context switching has a negative effect on the velocity.

### The user story format [Training wheels]
1. Card
1. Communication
1. Confirmation (Criteria)

On the back of a Story card, we need to define the acceptance criteria.

Example: I want to cancel a reservation.

Criteria:
Verif that a member can cancel the same day without paying a fee.
Verify that a non premium member is charged 10% when cancelling one day before departure.
Verify that the member receives an e-mail.

The acceptance criteria can be used to split up the story. So called "story crushing".
