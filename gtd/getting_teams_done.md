# Getting Teams Done

Holacracy is a combination of GTD and Agile and the starting point of it is that every employee enjoys autonomy working in a self organizing group or circle. Everyone is a leader within his or her own role.

## Key concepts

1. Sensors
1. Tensions
1. Roles and their responsibilities
1. Circles

Every employee is a sensor for tensions which are to be used as fuel to positively influence the performance of the team (hereafter circle) and the organisation.
Tensions are felt when there is a discrepancy between how things are going and how they should be according to the sensor.

## Meetings
In Holacracy, the agenda is determined during instead of prior to the meeting.

1. Stand-ups
1. Role meetings
1. Work meetings

#### Check-in
The check-in marks the beginning of the meeting. It allows for everyone to share what is on their mind so they can let it go and better focus on being in the present.

#### Check-out
Just as the check-in marks the beginning of a meeting, the check-out round is meant to finalize it in a conscious manner. During the check-out round every member of a circle is able to share with the rest of the circle, how they perceived the meeting. It helps to draw lessons from each other, solidify what has been discussed and to let go of the subjects discussed.

### The role meeting
The role meeting has the following format:

1. Check-in
1. Populating the agenda
1. Discussing each entry
1. Check-out

#### Populating the agenda
Depending on the preferences of the `facilitator` (more on this later) everyone adds one event at a time until there is nothing more to add. The idea is to build the agenda out of tensions within the circle. The focus during the role meeting is to discuss these tensions and the way the circle operates, not the work but the structure of the circle is important here.

It is not necessary to explain or go into detail about a tension that someone has felt. One or two keywords are more than enough for an event to be added to the roster.

#### Discussing each entry

### The work meeting

The work meeting has the following format:

1. Check-in
1. Recurring tasks
1. Indicators
1. Projects
1. Populating the agenda
1. Discussing each entry
1. Check-out
