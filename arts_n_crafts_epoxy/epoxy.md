# Epoxy resin

Working with epoxy resins is relatively straight forward assuming you keep in mind the following:

1. Epoxy resin will not bond to packaging tape allowing for cheap and easy way to apply a coating to your mold and easy removal after casting.
2. It is important to work in a dust free and preferably, well ventilated work environment. Specs of dust and other impurities will be extremely well visible in the end result.
3. When working with poreus materials such as wood, make sure to seal the surface with a couple of thin layers of resin before casting to prevent any air from leaking out and into your material.
4. After applying a new coat, use a blow dryer to break the surface tension allowing air bubbles to come to the service and pop. Keep about 15 centimeters of distance from your surface and repeat ever 15 to 25 minutes depending on the cure time.
5. It is best to keep a constant room temperature (21 degrees celsius is ideal)
6. Do the last bit of sanding using a steel sponge and some soapy water. The soap lubricates the surface allowing for a silky smooth finish.
